# Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

## Which capabilities can I get with add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Microsoft Teams capabilities. They give you the flexibility to add capabilities only for users in your organization who need them. To add a capability, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

The add-on licensing options available to you depend on the Microsoft Teams plan you have. To see which voice calling and audio conferencing options are available to you, see the [Which Microsoft capabilities are available with my plan?](#which-microsoft-capabilities-are-available-with-my-plan) section of this article.

Here's a list of Teams add-on licenses and their capabilities that you can add to your Teams subscription.

|License|Description|
|-------|-----------|
| **Microsoft Teams Premium** | Microsoft Teams Premium is a Teams add-on license that allows organizations with Microsoft 365 subscriptions and Teams licenses to enhance their Teams experience with benefits like more personalized and intelligent meetings, enhanced meeting protection, and advanced management and reporting capabilities. For more information about the Teams Premium add-on license, see [Microsoft Teams Premium licensing](licensing-enhance-teams.md). |
| **Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle** | The Teams Phone with Calling Plan license bundles Teams Phone System's PBX capabilities and a Domestic Calling Plan for PSTN connectivity. |
| **Teams Phone Standard** |[Teams Phone System](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) is a hosted telephone service that gives you call control and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities.

| **Microsoft Teams Calling Plans** | If your users need to call phone numbers outside your organization, you can purchase [Microsoft Teams Calling Plans](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md) to connect to PSTN phone numbers with Microsoft as your PSTN provider. There are Domestic Calling Plans, International Calling Plans, and Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plans. <br/> <br/> To find out whether Teams Calling Plans is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). |

If you want toll-free numbers for Audio Conferencing, auto attendants, or call queues, you'll need to [set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). |
| **Audio Conferencing** | Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a Teams meeting instead of their computer. [Set up Audio Conferencing](../set-up-audio-conferencing-in-teams.md) for users who schedule or lead meetings with attendees who need to call in using a phone. <br/> <br/>To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).

| **Microsoft Teams Shared Devices** | Many organizations require flexible workplace solutions as they shift to hybrid work scenarios. The Microsoft Teams Shared Devices license is designed to support hybrid work by allowing offices to designate devices as shared devices, including common area phones, Teams displays for hot-desks, and Teams panels for meeting spaces. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Shared Devices licensing](teams-shared-device-license.md). |

## Which Microsoft capabilities are available with my plan?

Most Microsoft 365 plans allow Teams users to make peer-to-peer calls within your organization using VoIP technology. However, you may want to add on different licenses for capabilities like making calls to PSTN numbers or setting up a PBX.
